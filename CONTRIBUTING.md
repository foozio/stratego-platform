5. Write clear, descriptive commit messages

### Coding Standards

- Follow the existing code style
- Use TypeScript for type safety

- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
- Run tests with: `npm test`

### Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for functions and components
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/)
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you
