# Accessibility

The Stratego Platform is committed to ensuring that our software is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This document outlines our accessibility goals, current status, and ongoing efforts.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to making the Stratego Platform accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This includes users with:

- Visual impairments (blindness, low vision, color blindness)
- Hearing impairments (deafness, hard of hearing)
- Motor impairments (limited mobility, dexterity issues)
- Cognitive impairments (learning disabilities, attention deficit disorders)
- Seizure disorders
- Temporary disabilities (broken arm, eye strain)

## Accessibility Standards

We aim to meet or exceed the following accessibility standards:

### WCAG 2.1
We strive to meet Level AA conformance of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, which is the current standard for web accessibility.

### Key Principles
- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable
- **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies

## Current Status

### Implemented Features
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Alt text for images
- Keyboard navigation support
- Sufficient color contrast
- Focus indicators
- ARIA labels and roles where appropriate
- Responsive design

### Areas for Improvement
- Screen reader compatibility testing
- Keyboard navigation enhancements
- Color contrast improvements
- Form labeling improvements
- Error identification and suggestions
- Consistent navigation
- Time-based media alternatives

## Ongoing Efforts

### Development Practices
- Accessibility considerations in all new features
- Regular accessibility audits
- Automated accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Manual testing with assistive technologies
- Training for development team

### Testing

- Keyboard-only navigation testing
- Color contrast analysis
- Automated testing tools (axe, pa11y, Lighthouse)
- User testing with people with disabilities

### Tools and Technologies
