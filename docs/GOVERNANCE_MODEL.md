# Governance Model

This document describes the governance model for the Stratego Platform project.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Project Creator

The Project Creator is Nuzli L. Hernawan (@foozio), who:

- Has final authority over project direction and decisions
- Maintains overall vision and roadmap
- Has final say in technical decisions when consensus cannot be reached
- Is responsible for the project's long-term sustainability

### Maintainers

Maintainers are trusted contributors who:

- Review and merge pull requests
- Manage issues and project boards
- Release new versions
- Help enforce the Code of Conduct
- Mentor new contributors
- Participate in project planning and roadmap discussions

Current maintainers:
- Nuzli L. Hernawan (@foozio) - Project Creator

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who:

- Submit pull requests
- Report issues
- Participate in discussions
- Improve documentation
- Help other community members

### Users

Users are community members who:

- Use the software
- Provide feedback
- Report bugs
- Request features
- Participate in discussions

## Decision Making Process

### Lazy Consensus

Most decisions are made through lazy consensus:

1. Proposals are made in issues or discussions
2. Maintainers and contributors discuss and provide feedback
3. If no objections are raised within a reasonable time (usually one week), the proposal is considered accepted
4. Objections must be accompanied by alternative solutions

### Voting

For controversial decisions where consensus cannot be reached:

1. Maintainers vote on the proposal
2. Simple majority wins
3. In case of a tie, the Project Creator has the deciding vote

### Appeal Process

If community members disagree with a decision:

1. Raise concerns in the appropriate forum (issue, discussion, etc.)
2. Request a formal review by maintainers
3. If still unsatisfied, contact the Project Creator directly

## Release Process

### Versioning

The project follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for backward-compatible functionality
- PATCH version for backward-compatible bug fixes

### Release Cadence

- Patch releases: As needed for critical bug fixes
- Minor releases: Every 2-3 months for new features
- Major releases: As needed for breaking changes

### Release Manager

The Project Creator is responsible for releases, but may delegate to maintainers.

## Contribution Process

### Pull Requests

1. All changes must go through pull requests
2. Pull requests must be reviewed by at least one maintainer
3. Automated tests must pass
4. Documentation must be updated when appropriate
5. Code must follow established style guidelines

### Issue Management

1. Issues are categorized with appropriate labels
2. Maintainers triage new issues
3. Stale issues are periodically reviewed and closed if inactive
4. Duplicate issues are consolidated

## Community Management

### Code of Conduct Enforcement

1. Maintainers are responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct
2. Serious violations are escalated to the Project Creator
3. Enforcement decisions are documented and communicated

### Communication Channels

1. GitHub Issues - For bug reports and feature requests
2. GitHub Discussions - For general discussion and questions
3. Social Media - For announcements and community engagement

## Becoming a Maintainer

### Requirements

To become a maintainer, a contributor must:

1. Have made significant contributions to the codebase
2. Demonstrate understanding of the project architecture
3. Show consistent adherence to project standards
4. Exhibit good judgment in technical decisions
5. Be responsive to community needs

### Process

1. Existing maintainers nominate candidates
2. Nomination is discussed among maintainers
3. Consensus is reached among maintainers
4. New maintainer is announced to the community

## Removing Maintainers

Maintainers may be removed for:

1. Extended inactivity (6+ months with no contributions)
2. Violation of the Code of Conduct

The process for removal:

1. Discussion among other maintainers

3. If unresolved, Project Creator makes final decision

## Changes to Governance

This governance model may be changed by:

1. Proposal in a GitHub issue or discussion
