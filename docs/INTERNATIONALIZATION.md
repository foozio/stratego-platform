# Internationalization and Localization Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for making the Stratego Platform available to users around the world through internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n).

## Overview

Internationalization is the process of designing and developing software so it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. Localization is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by translating text and adding locale-specific components.

## Goals

### Short-term Goals (6 months)
- Implement internationalization framework
- Support English as the base language
- Prepare for localization of key markets
- Establish translation workflow

### Medium-term Goals (12 months)
- Add support for 5 major languages
- Implement RTL (right-to-left) language support
- Add locale-specific formatting
- Establish community translation program

### Long-term Goals (24+ months)
- Support 15+ languages
- Implement advanced localization features
- Create professional translation partnerships
- Achieve full cultural adaptation

## Supported Languages

### Priority Languages
1. **English** (en) - Base language
2. **Spanish** (es) - High market demand
3. **French** (fr) - European market
4. **German** (de) - European market
5. **Japanese** (ja) - Asian market
6. **Chinese (Simplified)** (zh-CN) - Asian market
7. **Portuguese** (pt) - Brazilian market

### Additional Languages
8. **Italian** (it)
9. **Dutch** (nl)
10. **Russian** (ru)
11. **Korean** (ko)
12. **Arabic** (ar) - RTL support
13. **Hindi** (hi)
14. **Turkish** (tr)
15. **Polish** (pl)

## Technical Implementation
