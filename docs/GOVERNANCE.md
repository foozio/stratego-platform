# Governance

This document describes the governance model for the Stratego Platform project. As an open-source project, we believe in transparent and community-driven governance.

## Principles

### Openness
- All development happens in the open
- Decisions are made transparently
- Community input is valued and considered

### Meritocracy
- Leadership roles are based on merit and contributions
- Active contributors gain more responsibility
- Technical decisions are based on technical merit

### Inclusivity
- Everyone is welcome to participate
- Diverse perspectives are valued
- Barriers to entry are minimized

### Consensus
- Decisions are made by consensus when possible
- Voting is used when consensus cannot be reached
- Minority opinions are respected

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Users
Users are community members who use the software. They are the most important members of the community and their feedback is crucial for the project's success.

#### Responsibilities
- Provide feedback on the software
- Report bugs and issues
- Participate in discussions
- Help other users when possible

### Contributors
Contributors are community members who contribute to the project in various ways, including code, documentation, testing, and community support.

#### Responsibilities
- Follow the code of conduct
- Submit high-quality contributions
- Participate in code reviews
- Help maintain the project

#### How to Become a Contributor
- Submit a pull request
- Improve documentation
- Help with testing
- Participate in community discussions

### Maintainers
Maintainers are experienced contributors who help manage the project. They have write access to the repository and are responsible for reviewing and merging contributions.

#### Responsibilities
- Review and merge pull requests
- Manage issues and discussions
- Release new versions
- Guide the project's direction
- Mentor new contributors

#### How to Become a Maintainer
- Demonstrate consistent high-quality contributions
- Show leadership in the community
- Be nominated by existing maintainers
- Be approved by the project creator

### Project Creator
The project creator (Nuzli L. Hernawan) has ultimate authority over the project's direction and makes final decisions when consensus cannot be reached.

#### Responsibilities
- Set the overall vision for the project
- Make final decisions on controversial issues
- Ensure the project stays true to its mission
- Appoint and remove maintainers

## Decision Making Process

### Lazy Consensus
Most decisions are made through lazy consensus. This means that any community member can propose a change, and if no one objects within a reasonable time frame, the change is accepted.

### Discussion and Consensus
For more significant decisions, a discussion period is held to gather input from the community. The goal is to reach consensus among all participants.

### Voting
If consensus cannot be reached, a vote may be held. Voting is typically reserved for:
- Election of new maintainers
- Major architectural decisions
- Changes to the governance model
- Licensing changes

### Final Authority
The project creator has final authority on all decisions. This authority is used sparingly and only when necessary to resolve conflicts or make critical decisions.

## Conflict Resolution

### Code of Conduct Enforcement
The Code of Conduct is enforced by the project maintainers. Serious violations may result in temporary or permanent bans from the community.

### Dispute Resolution
When conflicts arise:
1. Try to resolve the issue through discussion
2. If needed, contact the project maintainers
3. As a last resort, the project creator will make a final decision

## Communication

### Channels
- GitHub Issues: For bug reports and feature requests
- GitHub Pull Requests: For code contributions
- GitHub Discussions: For general discussion
- Discord: For real-time communication

### Language
All official communication is conducted in English to ensure maximum accessibility.

## Meetings

### Regular Meetings
Regular meetings may be held for maintainers and active contributors to discuss project direction and coordinate work.

### Community Meetings
Community meetings may be held periodically to gather feedback and discuss upcoming changes.
