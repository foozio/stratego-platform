## Vulnerability Management

### Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

#### Reporting Process
1. **Private Disclosure**: Send details to security@stratego-platform.com
2. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
3. **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the report
4. **Remediation**: We will develop and test a fix
5. **Coordination**: We will coordinate public disclosure timing
6. **Credit**: We will credit reporters (with permission)

#### Response Timeline
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: 24 hours acknowledgment, 7 days fix
- **High Vulnerabilities**: 48 hours acknowledgment, 14 days fix
- **Medium Vulnerabilities**: 72 hours acknowledgment, 30 days fix
- **Low Vulnerabilities**: 1 week acknowledgment, 60 days fix

#### Scope
- **In Scope**: Core platform, official extensions, documentation
- **Out of Scope**: Third-party integrations, user customizations, self-hosted deployments (unless platform issue)

### Vulnerability Response Process

#### Triage
1. Assess severity using CVSS scoring
2. Determine affected versions
3. Assign priority and timeline
4. Notify relevant team members

#### Remediation
1. Develop fix in private branch
2. Test fix thoroughly
3. Prepare security advisory
4. Coordinate release timing

#### Communication
1. Internal notification to team
2. Private notification to key users (for critical issues)
3. Public disclosure via security advisory
4. CVE assignment when appropriate

## Security Controls

### Authentication and Authorization

#### Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
- Optional MFA for all user accounts
- Mandatory MFA for administrative accounts

### Data Protection

#### Encryption
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Key Management**: Hardware security modules (HSM) for production
- **End-to-End Encryption**: For sensitive communications

#### Data Classification
- **Public**: Non-sensitive information
- **Internal**: Organization-specific data
- **Confidential**: Business-sensitive information
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive data (PII, financial, etc.)

#### Data Lifecycle Management
